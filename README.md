# Hi there 👋

My name is Genuel Zapanta and I am a communicator with experience in design and media. I am making a career transition at the moment and am working towards becoming a SWE. I like gaming, anime and vlogging.

I am making this as a tracker/portfolio in my career transition into SWE and beyond. I will hopefully be filling and updating this every now and then with updates on what I have done and general thoughts.
