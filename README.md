### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am making this as a tracker/portfolio in my career transition into SWE and beyond. I will hopefully be filling and updating this every now and then with updates on what I have done and general thoughts.

In highschool and and part of university I really liked to build and program however in University I had a bad experience and walked away from it. I'm currently looking to get back into the space by being self taught with a bootcamp to boost my learning and give direction.
